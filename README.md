# Customer churn prediction

Churn rate is a marketing metric that describes the number of customers who leave a business over a specific time period. Every user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value is based on:

* User demographic information
* Browsing behavior
* Historical purchase data among other information
It factors in our unique and proprietary predictions of how long a user will remain a customer. This score is updated every day for all users who have a minimum of one conversion. The values assigned are between 1 and 5.

Recognizing the significance of customer churn, as it's far more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, this project aims to develop a robust predictive model. This model will effectively pinpoint customers at high risk of churn based on their historical interactions and distinctive characteristics, helping companies proactively address churn and foster long-term customer relationships.
